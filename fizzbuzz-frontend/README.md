# Frontend FizzBuzz

This is a simple frontend application that allows you to input a number and get a FizzBuzz result. It was created to demonstrate frontend unit testing and also includes a couple of image assets comparing different types of testing. The React/TS project was created with Vite, uses vitest for testing and Node version v21.6.1.

## Instructions

1. Open project folder in VSCode or similar editor. Open terminal and run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser to see the app
3. Then open another terminal and run:

```
npx vitest
```

4. Check that all tests ok

5. Extend the functionality of the FizzBuzz component to handle a range of numbers. If for example the range is 1-5 the rendered output should be 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz. The added functionality should be covered      by unit tests.

   TDD is often difficult in frontend development but at least try to write the 'it' clauses in the tests before implementing the functionality. This can be a good way of "rubber ducking" the requirements.

8. Commit and push your changes to your fork on GitHub
